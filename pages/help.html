      Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, your
      guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an
      overview of what <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is, how it can
      benefit you, and how to use it.
    </p>
    <h3 class="blue-text">What is Join?</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
      tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their
      web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br /><br />
      Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method
      to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or
      flow). <span class="blue-text">Join</span> leverages the principles of
      kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
      visual interface.<br /><br />
      It is important to note that <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is
      designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
      business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user
      experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability,
      accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding

    <h3 class="blue-text">How to use it</h3>

      Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use

        <h4 class="darkblue-text">Exploring the Board</h4>
        <p>
          When you log in to <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, you'll find a
          default board. This board represents your project and contains four
          default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

        <h4 class="darkblue-text">Creating Contacts</h4>
        <p>
          In <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
          collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
          "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
          contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on
          the board.

        <h4 class="darkblue-text">Adding Cards</h4>
        <p>
          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
          represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
          list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
          task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

      <div>
        <h4 class="darkblue-text">Moving Cards</h4>
        <p>
          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
          the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.

      <div>
        <h4 class="darkblue-text">Deleting Carts</h4>
        <p>
          Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
          delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
          Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
          irreversible. Remember that using
          <span class="blue-text">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
          updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the
          current state of your project. Have more questions about
          <span class="blue-text">Join</span>? Feel free to contact us at [Your
